In this repository are my files for the Soundscape Narrative preview. I included a screenshot of when I began creating my Audacity project and I have also attached my work in progress Audacity file and an mp3 playable file.
This is a work in progress and I am still not fully comfortable with GitHub so I hope this works well.
My complete project will be at least 3-4 minutes I hope and this is only the very beginning stages.
So far, the story is supposed to be two explorers making their way through a peaceful forest/jungle and they run into dangers throughout the way. What I have expressed so far is the danger in a lion and then it transitions into a chase scene.
I have yet to add more after the initial chase scene but in my story that I wrote out, they escape from the mountain lion and eventually get to their goal but it comes with a cost.
